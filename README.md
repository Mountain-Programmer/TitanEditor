# Titan HUD Generator
 ## Overview
   Titan (name not final) is a graphical editor for Black Ops 3 LUA User Interfaces. Titan aims to lower the barrier to entry and make adding custom HUD elements to a Black Ops 3 map easier. 

### Features
- Public Image Pool
  - Out of the box, Titan supplies commonly used HUD images 
  - User-uploaded images coming soon 

- Automatic LUA HUD Generation
  - Titan's LUA generator engine makes it easy and fast to add custom elements to your map.
  - What you see in the editor should be exactly what you see in your map, no more guessing the position or alignment of HUD elements.
  - Advanced features such as reactive elements will further reduce barrier to entry for more advanced and polished HUDs for your maps

- Dashboard and Documentation 
  - Plans for Titan include a dashboard that allows saving HUD designs and reopening them, view other users HUD ideas, and sharing HUD assets
  - Publically available GSC & Extracted LUA scripts will be added, so all the information you need for building your map is in the same easily accessible place. Code browsing will include searching, jump to definition (if applicable), reference listing and jumping.
